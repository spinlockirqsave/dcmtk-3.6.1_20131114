ASSOCIATION NEGOTIATION PROFILES AND CONFIGURATION FILES

  Beginning with release 3.5.3, DCMTK provides a flexible mechanism for
  specifying the DICOM network association negotiation behaviour of an
  application, based on so-called "association negotiation profiles"
  which may be read from a configuration file.

  This mechanism is currently enabled in the storescu and storescp
  applications.


1. CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

  The configuration file is a simple text file resembling well-known
  "INI" files on the Windows platform.  Lines consisting only of
  whitespace characters and comment lines starting with a '#' character
  in the first column are ignored.  Configuration file entries use the
  following syntax:
  Key = Value

  The key must start in the first column of the line.  The case is not
  significant for the key, however, it is for the value.  Whitespace
  characters before and after the '=' separating key and value are
  ignored.

  Entries are grouped into sections using section headings, which are
  also insensitive to case and whitespace characters:
  [Section]

  The well-known "INI" syntax is extended by the definition of
  supersections which define a grouping for sections, using the
  following syntax:
  [[Supersection]]

  The content of the configuration file needs to establish a true tree
  structure, i. e. each setting must be part of a section and each
  section must be part of one supersection.


2. CONFIGURATION FILE STRUCTURE

  A configuration file for association negotiation profiles may contain
  the following supersections:
  [[TransferSyntaxes]]
  [[PresentationContexts]]
  [[Profiles]]
  [[SCPSCURoleSelection]]
  [[ExtendedNegotiation]]
  The first three supersections are mandatory, the others are optional.


2.1 TRANSFER SYNTAXES

This supersection contains one or more sections with arbitrary
user-defined but unique section names that are used as symbolic labels.
Within each section, one or more key/value pairs are contained.  The key
names are "TransferSyntax1", "TransferSyntax2" etc. (without leading
zeroes before the number!), in increasing order.

The values may either be DICOM Unique Identifiers (UIDs) in the form
defined by the DICOM standard, or symbolic UID names as used throughout
DCMTK and defined in the "UID Name Map" in file dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc.
Each value must denote a standard or private DICOM transfer syntax.
Within each section (transfer syntax list), no transfer syntax should be
repeated.

The following example shows two sections (transfer syntax lists), one
using symbolic transfer syntax names, another using a numeric UID.

[Uncompressed]
TransferSyntax1 = LittleEndianExplicit
TransferSyntax2 = BigEndianExplicit
TransferSyntax3 = LittleEndianImplicit

[JPEGBaseline]
TransferSyntax1 = 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50

There are two special symbolic transfer syntax names that are recognized
by the parser: "LocalEndianExplicit" and "OppositeEndianExplicit".  These
are interpreted at runtime depending on the byte order of the machine
on which the application is executed:

On a little endian machine (e.g. x86)
  - "LocalEndianExplicit" is interpreted as "LittleEndianExplicit"
  - "OppositeEndianExplicit" is interpreted as "BigEndianExplicit"

On a big endian machine (Sparc, M68K, MIPS)
  - "LocalEndianExplicit" is interpreted as "BigEndianExplicit"
  - "OppositeEndianExplicit" is interpreted as "LittleEndianExplicit"


2.2 PRESENTATION CONTEXTS

This supersection contains one or more sections with arbitrary
user-defined but unique section names that are used as symbolic labels.
Within each section, one or more key/value pairs are contained.  The key
names are "PresentationContext1", "PresentationContext2" etc., in
increasing order.  Each list must not contain more than 128 entries,
due to the limitation of the DICOM network protocol to 128 presentation
contexts per association.

Each value consists of two parts, separated by a single backslash
character ('\').  The first value denotes a DICOM SOP Class UID or
Meta SOP Class UID, standard or private.  Again either a numeric UID
or a symbolic value as defined in DCMTK can be used.

The second part denotes a list of transfer syntaxes defined in the
[[TransferSyntaxes]] supersection.  The list is referenced by its
section header, which is used as a symbolic label here.

The following example shows one presentation context list that could
be used by an association requestor (Store SCU) to negotiate both
lossy-compressed and uncompressed transmission of DICOM ultrasound
images.

[StorageSCUJPEGBaselineAndUncompressed]
PresentationContext1 = UltrasoundImageStorage\JPEGBaseline
PresentationContext2 = UltrasoundImageStorage\Uncompressed
PresentationContext3 = UltrasoundMultiframeImageStorage\JPEGBaseline
PresentationContext4 = UltrasoundMultiframeImageStorage\Uncompressed

In the case of an association acceptor (SCP), each SOP class must appear
only once in the list.  The following example would be a valid transfer
syntax list for an SCP, accepting only uncompressed ultrasound images:

[StorageSCPUncompressed]
PresentationContext1 = UltrasoundImageStorage\Uncompressed
PresentationContext2 = UltrasoundMultiframeImageStorage\Uncompressed

It should be noted that it is the user's responsibility to enforce the
rules defined in the DICOM standard on default transfer syntaxes, i. e.
LittleEndianImplicit has to be offered/accepted for each SOP class in at
least one presentation context unless the image is only available in
lossy compressed form.


2.3 SCP/SCU ROLE SELECTION

This optional supersection contains one or more sections with arbitrary
user-defined but unique section names that are used as symbolic labels.
Within each section, one or more key/value pairs are contained.  The key
names are "Role1", "Role2" etc., in increasing order.

Each value consists of two parts, separated by a single backslash
character ('\').  The first value denotes a DICOM SOP Class UID or
Meta SOP Class UID, standard or private.  Again either a numeric UID
or a symbolic value as defined in DCMTK can be used.  Each SOP class
should only appear once in the list.

The second part denotes the roles the application is going to negotiate
for this SOP class.  Possible keywords are "SCU", "SCP", or "BOTH",
indicating that the application supports the SCU role, the SCP role or
both roles.  Any SOP class that is negotiated but not contained in the
SCP/SCU role selection list will be negotiated with default roles,
i. e. association requestor is SCU and association acceptor is SCP.

The following example shows a list for SCP/SCU role selection where
an application supports both SCU and SCP roles for transmission
of ultrasound images.

[USStorageBothRoles]
Role1 = UltrasoundImageStorage\BOTH
Role2 = UltrasoundMultiframeImageStorage\BOTH

It should be noted that neither storescu nor storescp currently support
SCP/SCU role negotiation, so this functionality should not be used with
these two tools.


2.4 EXTENDED NEGOTIATION

This optional supersection contains one or more sections with arbitrary
user-defined but unique section names that are used as symbolic labels.
Within each section, one or more key/value pairs are contained.  The key
names are "ExtendedNegotiation1", "ExtendedNegotiation2" etc., in
increasing order.

Each value consists of two parts, separated by a single backslash
character ('\').  The first value denotes a DICOM SOP Class UID or
Meta SOP Class UID, standard or private.  Again either a numeric UID
or a symbolic value as defined in DCMTK can be used.  Each SOP class
should only appear once in the list.

The second part denotes the SOP class extended negotiation to be
performed for this SOP class.  This part contains raw data in hexadecimal
encoding.  Any SOP class that is negotiated but not contained in the
extended negotiation list will be negotiated without extended
negotiation.

In the current (2008) edition of the DICOM standard, extended
negotiation is only defined for the SOP classes of the Storage, Basic
Worklist Management and Query/Retrieve Service Classes.

The following example shows an extended negotiation list for a
storage SCP that accepts Structured Reporting documents as a
"Level 2 SCP", with "Signature Level 3" and no element coercion
(see DICOM part 4, section B.3.1 for details).

[USSignaturePreservingSCP]
ExtendedNegotiation1 = UltrasoundImageStorage\020003000000
ExtendedNegotiation2 = UltrasoundMultiframeImageStorage\020003000000


2.5 PROFILES

This supersection contains one or more sections with arbitrary
user-defined but unique section names that are used as symbolic labels
identifying complete "profiles" for association negotiation that
can be selected by a user or application.

Each profile consists at least of a reference to one list of
presentation contexts.  It may also reference one list of SCP/SCU role
selection items and one list of extended negotiation items, but both of
these are optional.  The references use the symbolic section names
defined in the supersections for presentation contexts, role selection
and extended negotiation.

The following example shows a profile of a hypothetical Storage SCP that
supports the DICOM ultrasound image storage SOP classes both in lossy
JPEG and uncompressed form, supports both SCP and SCU roles for these
SOP classes and also guarantees signature preserving behaviour using
extended negotiation.

[UltrasoundProfile]
PresentationContexts = StorageSCPJPEGBaselineAndUncompressed
SCPSCURoleSelection  = USStorageBothRoles
ExtendedNegotiation  = USSignaturePreservingSCP

A configuration file may contain one or more association negotiation
profiles, but each association request or association negotiation
procedure can use exactly one of these profiles.


3. EXAMPLES

Examples for association negotiation profiles that can be used
with the storescu and storescp tools are provided with DCMTK, as
"storescp.cfg" and "storescu.cfg" in the &lt;etcdir&gt; directory.
